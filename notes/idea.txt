I want to make a sophisticated stock AI bot in python where the model gets trained to scrape a very vast and large amounts of data on the internet to learn what best choices to invest in, whether it be stocks, crypto, index funds, etc. I also want it to scrape what the top investors are investing in as well, and just any information it deems necessary to calculate the best investments. I also want to use an appealing UI and design (likely using tqdm and rich libraries). I'm going to make the learning rate really low (even though it may take a lot more time to learn, train, and process) so it's more reliable, optimize and efficient (and since I have a nvidia 3080ti with a ryzen 5900x to train the model however long I want). I would like to also add on a training program that anyone can download and use to own compute power to assist in training the model such that it becomes more efficient, optimized, and reliable. I also want to have it give the user options as to how much risk it is alloted to make, how much money total to give it (and have the ai stock bot make the decisions itself on what to do with that money) and, if they want to invest in options, and etc. In all, I want this to become one of the best stock AI bot I can possibly make it with your help. How can I go about this?
