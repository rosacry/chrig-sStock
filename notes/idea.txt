I want to make a very complex, high-level, and sophisticated stock AI bot that uses machine learning indicators in python where the model gets trained to scrape a very vast and large amounts of data on the internet to learn what best choices to invest/sell in and buys and sell assets itself, whether it be stocks, crypto, and options. I also want it to scrape what the top investors are investing in as well, and just any information you deem necessary to calculate the best investments. I also want to use an appealing UI and design. I want to make the learning rate really low (even though it may take a lot more time to learn, train, and process) so it's more reliable, optimized and efficient (and since I have a nvidia 3080ti with a ryzen 5900x to train the model however long I want).I would like to also add on a training program that anyone can download and use to own compute power to assist in training the model such that it becomes more efficient, optimized, and reliable. With my computer specs, I want to train the model 24/7 (or for however long) and make it such that other people can join on the program and assist with training the model. I also want to have it give the user options as to how much risk it is allotted to make, how much money total to give it (and have the ai stock bot make the decisions itself on what to do with that money) and, if they want to invest/sell in stocks, crypto, options, or for the ai/model to make the decision for them on that. I'm using Google Cloud Compute Engine with Ray framework. In all, I want this to become one of the best stock AI bot I can possibly make it with your help.

alright lets recap, I want to make a very complex, high-level, and sophisticated stock AI bot in python where the model gets trained to scrape a very vast and large amounts of data on the internet to learn what best choices to invest in, whether it be stocks, crypto, index funds, etc. I also want it to scrape what the top investors are investing in as well, and just any information it deems necessary to calculate the best investments. I also want to use an appealing UI and design (likely using tqdm and rich libraries). I'm going to make the learning rate really low (even though it may take a lot more time to learn, train, and process) so it's more reliable, optimize and efficient (and since I have a nvidia 3080ti with a ryzen 5900x to train the model however long I want). I would like to also add on a training program that anyone can download and use to own compute power to assist in training the model such that it becomes more efficient, optimized, and reliable. I also want to have it give the user options as to how much risk it is alloted to make, how much money total to give it (and have the ai stock bot make the decisions itself on what to do with that money) and, if they want to invest in options, and etc. In all, I want this to become one of the best stock AI bot I can possibly make it with your help.
Here is the overall tree structure of what i did (paste tree here). I've attached all associated files, What are the next steps?



changes:

api/api_clients.py:
    Error Handling: While retry logic is present, consider logging failed requests or specific errors to track persistent issues.
    Additional Crypto or Index APIs: Explore incorporating more APIs if a specific client doesn't return sufficient data.

data/data_processing.py
    Logging: Consider adding logging for errors or issues that occur during data processing.

distributed/distributed_training.py:
    Exception Handling: Consider adding error handling or logging in the training loop for debugging.

models/model_training.py:
    Scoring Metric: Consider making the scoring metric configurable via a parameter for flexibility.

models/model_tuning.py:
    Reduce Redundancy: This file appears to overlap in functionality with model_training.py. You could combine them to reduce redundancy and differentiate only based on parameter grids or other criteria.

optimization/unified_tuning.py:
    Configuration Parameters: Consider making asset_symbol and asset_type configurable via command-line arguments or a configuration file.
    Logging and Visualization:
        Implement logging to capture model training and optimization results.
        Visualize optimization results (e.g., feature importance, hyperparameter distributions).

ui/cli.py:
    Error Handling: Add error handling for unsupported asset types or data not being available.
    Additional Options: Consider adding further training modes or model choices.

ui/streamlit_app.py:
    Data Visualization:
        Add graphical representations (e.g., line charts for predictions) to visualize model outputs.
    Input Validation:
        Consider validating asset symbols or providing suggestions for known assets.

utils/logging.py:
    Log Directory: Consider allowing the log directory to be specified via an environment variable or configuration file.
    Log Levels: Make the log level configurable via a parameter to provide flexibility between development (DEBUG) and production (INFO) modes.


merge model_training and model_tuning?

create the main.py

ask gpt attaching all files and vision prompt to see if it works all well together

1. Testing and Validation:

    Unit Tests: Write unit tests for individual functions to ensure correctness. Include edge cases.
    Integration Tests: Test end-to-end workflows with realistic data inputs and asset types (stocks, crypto, etc.).
    Model Performance Evaluation:
        Compare model predictions with historical data to validate their reliability.
        Refine models based on their evaluation metrics.

2. Deployment and User Training:

    Deployment Strategy:
        Local: Create virtual environments and Docker containers for easy local testing.
        Distributed Training: Develop a user-friendly guide for setting up distributed training.
        Cloud-Based: Consider deploying on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalable performance.

such that there's an option only to train the ai/model, not options as to which training mode to choose, since I updated the #file:model_training.py file, #file:optuna_optimization.py file, and #file:unified_tuning.py such that it does both the advanced grid search and optuna optimization itself. When you choose to train the ai/model, you can train it 24/7 (or for however long) and make it such that other people can join on the program and assist with training the model.


now create the run_cli() function in the #file:main.py that does this as well and with reference to the #file:cli.py file

main.py:






    Main Script (main.py):
        The primary script connects all components and starts the bot.
        Provides both CLI and Streamlit interfaces, giving users flexibility in interacting with the bot.
        Improvement: Add a fallback mechanism for unexpected input, and handle exceptions more gracefully.

    Distributed Training (distributed_training.py):
        Implements distributed training via PyTorch DDP.
        Clearly documents the setup, cleanup, and training process.
