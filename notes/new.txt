ai proposed changes:

Main Script (main.py):
        The primary script connects all components and starts the bot.
        Provides both CLI and Streamlit interfaces, giving users flexibility in interacting with the bot.
        Improvement: Add a fallback mechanism for unexpected input, and handle exceptions more gracefully.

    Distributed Training (distributed_training.py):
        Implements distributed training via PyTorch DDP.
        Clearly documents the setup, cleanup, and training process.
        Improvement: Consider including learning rate scheduling and adaptive optimizers for efficiency.

    Model Optimization (optuna_optimization.py, model_training.py, model_tuning.py):
        Optuna Optimization: Implements parameter tuning using Optuna, making it suitable for automated hyperparameter tuning.
        Model Training: Provides advanced grid search to train and select optimal models.
        Model Tuning: Implements GridSearchCV across different models.
        Improvement: Enhance grid search by including additional regression models.

    User Interface (cli.py, streamlit_app.py):
        CLI: Rich and TQDM provide an appealing user experience, and the CLI covers various investment options.
        Streamlit App: A comprehensive dashboard for model training, optimization, and collaborative training.
        Improvement: Consider logging user choices and feedback for future enhancements.

    Data Collection & Processing (api_clients.py, data_processing.py, load_data.py):
        API Clients: Includes reusable clients for various APIs with retry mechanisms.
        Data Processing: Handles cleaning and normalizing data effectively.
        Load Data: Combines feature engineering and processing into a cohesive function.
        Improvement: Add failover for missing API keys and improve error handling.

    Feature Engineering (feature_engineering.py):
        Generates key technical indicators for training models.
        Improvement: Consider additional features like Bollinger Bands, MACD, and more.

    Unified Tuning (unified_tuning.py):
        Combines grid search and Optuna-based tuning into a unified approach.
        Improvement: Separate concerns by decoupling tuning types for clearer implementation.


    and


api/api_clients.py:
    Error Handling: While retry logic is present, consider logging failed requests or specific errors to track persistent issues.
    Additional Crypto or Index APIs: Explore incorporating more APIs if a specific client doesn't return sufficient data.

data/data_processing.py
    Logging: Consider adding logging for errors or issues that occur during data processing.

distributed/distributed_training.py:
    Exception Handling: Consider adding error handling or logging in the training loop for debugging.

models/model_training.py:
    Scoring Metric: Consider making the scoring metric configurable via a parameter for flexibility.

models/model_tuning.py:
    Reduce Redundancy: This file appears to overlap in functionality with model_training.py. You could combine them to reduce redundancy and differentiate only based on parameter grids or other criteria.

optimization/unified_tuning.py:
    Configuration Parameters: Consider making asset_symbol and asset_type configurable via command-line arguments or a configuration file.
    Logging and Visualization:
        Implement logging to capture model training and optimization results.
        Visualize optimization results (e.g., feature importance, hyperparameter distributions).

ui/cli.py:
    Error Handling: Add error handling for unsupported asset types or data not being available.
    Additional Options: Consider adding further training modes or model choices.

ui/streamlit_app.py:
    Data Visualization:
        Add graphical representations (e.g., line charts for predictions) to visualize model outputs.
    Input Validation:
        Consider validating asset symbols or providing suggestions for known assets.

utils/logging.py:
    Log Directory: Consider allowing the log directory to be specified via an environment variable or configuration file.
    Log Levels: Make the log level configurable via a parameter to provide flexibility between development (DEBUG) and production (INFO) modes.


streamlit_app.py layout:

Buttons:
Train - (Joins collaborative Training session to train all data provided by the accumulation of all the financial leverage api's overtime
Deposit - User deposits money
Withdraw - User Withdraws money
Risk - User can decide the risk (low, medium, high)

Once the user deposits money, the bot starts and never ends (i want to put it on a server or something), the ai/model now makes decisions on what to buy and sell and at what time by itself. the training button helps make the model better along the way.

Upload your model files using the gsutil command:

    gsutil cp path/to/your/model_file gs://your-gcs-bucket/model_directory/

Accessing Models from GCS:

    In your Python code, use the google-cloud-storage library to download models:

python

from google.cloud import storage

def download_model_from_gcs(bucket_name, source_blob_name, destination_file_name):
    """Downloads a model file from the specified GCS bucket."""
    client = storage.Client()
    bucket = client.bucket(bucket_name)
    blob = bucket.blob(source_blob_name)
    blob.download_to_filename(destination_file_name)
    print(f"Model downloaded to {destination_file_name}.")

Automate Model Updates:

    Automate the upload process by creating a script that uploads models to GCS after each training session.



update unified_tuning such that it adds model_tuning

create the join_collaborative_training() function in the streamlit_app.py file such that it connects everything together given my attached files.


make models more modular, implement correctly in distributed_training.py

create an evaluation for the ai/model


fix stupid prompt in root cloud 10rosa....


The user should only have these options:
Deposit funds - User deposits funds

Withdraw funds - The Ai decides best what to sell at the moment given how much the user wants to withdraw

Risk level - low, medium, high

Investment Type - Stocks, Crypto, Options, or let the AI decide

Starting AI Bot - Once the user starts it, they're allowed stop their machine instance on their own machine and the AI bot won't stop, since it'll be running on the server side (but every person has their own independent bot with the latest update model)

Join Collaborate Training - Where the User connects to the GCE that uses ray, where they user can use their personal computational power to assist with training and tuning the overall model.

The model will update everyday since the leveraging financial api's will scrape for new information everyday, which performs retraining and incremental learning on the model, where the model will update itself constantly without the user having to do anything regardless if their AI bot is still running
