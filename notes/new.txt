    make sure the bot sells as well when necessary

    modify necessary files to a class based structure 

    fix much such that it aligns with cli.py

    add option in cli and streamlit_app where user can add their api keys for given financial leverage

    add functionality for the ai/model to buy/sell the stock independently

    make sure the ai/model gets trained to scrape all stock, option, and crypto data from all given leverage financial api's


ai proposed changes:

Main Script (main.py):
        The primary script connects all components and starts the bot.
        Provides both CLI and Streamlit interfaces, giving users flexibility in interacting with the bot.
        Improvement: Add a fallback mechanism for unexpected input, and handle exceptions more gracefully.

    Distributed Training (distributed_training.py):
        Implements distributed training via PyTorch DDP.
        Clearly documents the setup, cleanup, and training process.
        Improvement: Consider including learning rate scheduling and adaptive optimizers for efficiency.

    Model Optimization (optuna_optimization.py, model_training.py, model_tuning.py):
        Optuna Optimization: Implements parameter tuning using Optuna, making it suitable for automated hyperparameter tuning.
        Model Training: Provides advanced grid search to train and select optimal models.
        Model Tuning: Implements GridSearchCV across different models.
        Improvement: Enhance grid search by including additional regression models.

    User Interface (cli.py, streamlit_app.py):
        CLI: Rich and TQDM provide an appealing user experience, and the CLI covers various investment options.
        Streamlit App: A comprehensive dashboard for model training, optimization, and collaborative training.
        Improvement: Consider logging user choices and feedback for future enhancements.

    Data Collection & Processing (api_clients.py, data_processing.py, load_data.py):
        API Clients: Includes reusable clients for various APIs with retry mechanisms.
        Data Processing: Handles cleaning and normalizing data effectively.
        Load Data: Combines feature engineering and processing into a cohesive function.
        Improvement: Add failover for missing API keys and improve error handling.

    Feature Engineering (feature_engineering.py):
        Generates key technical indicators for training models.
        Improvement: Consider additional features like Bollinger Bands, MACD, and more.

    Unified Tuning (unified_tuning.py):
        Combines grid search and Optuna-based tuning into a unified approach.
        Improvement: Separate concerns by decoupling tuning types for clearer implementation.


    and


api/api_clients.py:
    Error Handling: While retry logic is present, consider logging failed requests or specific errors to track persistent issues.
    Additional Crypto or Index APIs: Explore incorporating more APIs if a specific client doesn't return sufficient data.

data/data_processing.py
    Logging: Consider adding logging for errors or issues that occur during data processing.

distributed/distributed_training.py:
    Exception Handling: Consider adding error handling or logging in the training loop for debugging.

models/model_training.py:
    Scoring Metric: Consider making the scoring metric configurable via a parameter for flexibility.

models/model_tuning.py:
    Reduce Redundancy: This file appears to overlap in functionality with model_training.py. You could combine them to reduce redundancy and differentiate only based on parameter grids or other criteria.

optimization/unified_tuning.py:
    Configuration Parameters: Consider making asset_symbol and asset_type configurable via command-line arguments or a configuration file.
    Logging and Visualization:
        Implement logging to capture model training and optimization results.
        Visualize optimization results (e.g., feature importance, hyperparameter distributions).

ui/cli.py:
    Error Handling: Add error handling for unsupported asset types or data not being available.
    Additional Options: Consider adding further training modes or model choices.

ui/streamlit_app.py:
    Data Visualization:
        Add graphical representations (e.g., line charts for predictions) to visualize model outputs.
    Input Validation:
        Consider validating asset symbols or providing suggestions for known assets.

utils/logging.py:
    Log Directory: Consider allowing the log directory to be specified via an environment variable or configuration file.
    Log Levels: Make the log level configurable via a parameter to provide flexibility between development (DEBUG) and production (INFO) modes.


streamlit_app.py layout:

Buttons:
Train - (Joins collaborative Training session to train all data provided by the accumulation of all the financial leverage api's overtime
Deposit - User deposits money
Withdraw - User Withdraws money
Risk - User can decide the risk (low, medium, high)

Once the user deposits money, the bot starts and never ends (i want to put it on a server or something), the ai/model now makes decisions on what to buy and sell and at what time by itself. the training button helps make the model better along the way.
