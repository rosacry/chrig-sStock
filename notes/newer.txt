implement these functions:
    update_user_funds, withdraw_user_funds, fetch_portfolio_data

model_training.py
    fix pre_trained_model_path (make sure it performs incremental learning and retraining)

model_tuning.py
    modify the algorithm such that only model_training.py takes information from data_processing.py

optuna_optimization.py
    modify the algorithm such that only model_training.py takes information from data_processing.py

distributed_training.py
    make sure model_training, model_tuning, and optuna_optimization.py are correctly implemented

for all models modify parameters for machine learning and that the model performs incremental learning and retraining
