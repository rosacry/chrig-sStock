Recent Accomplishments:

1. Full-Scale Model Testing and Validation:
- Completed the full-scale testing of the machine learning model using the comprehensive dataset that includes the new financial indicators. The tests confirmed that the model performs reliably across various market scenarios, showing improved predictive accuracy thanks to the enhanced features.
- The model has been successfully adapted to incremental learning, allowing it to update continuously with new data, which keeps it responsive to market changes without full retraining.

2. System Integration and Continuous Monitoring:
- The integration of the updated model with the web scraping modules and the data pipeline is now fully operational. The system operates cohesively, with real-time data feeding into the model seamlessly.
- Implemented continuous monitoring tools that track the systemâ€™s performance and alert for any anomalies or performance degradations, ensuring quick response to potential issues.

Further tasks will focus on final adjustments for deployment and user interface enhancements as we progress toward the launch. Regular updates will be provided.
