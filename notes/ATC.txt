This will involve testing the user registration, login, and all transaction-related endpoints to ensure they function as expected. Here’s how we'll proceed:
Steps for Functionality Checks

    User Registration and Login:
        Test the registration endpoint to ensure it correctly handles new user registrations, including input validation and response.
        Test the login endpoint for accurate authentication and token issuance.

    Transaction Handling:
        Verify that deposit and withdrawal endpoints correctly update user balances and log transactions in the database.
        Ensure that error handling is robust and provides clear, informative messages for failed operations.

    Endpoint Security:
        Confirm that all protected endpoints correctly require authentication and reject invalid or expired tokens.

    Data Validation:
        Ensure that all input data is properly validated before processing to prevent SQL injection and other common vulnerabilities.

Tools and Methods for Testing

    Postman or Swagger UI: Use these tools to manually test API endpoints. Swagger UI is particularly useful as it also provides documentation for your API.
    Pytest for Automated Testing: Implement automated tests to simulate requests and check responses programmatically. This ensures consistency in testing.
    Logging: Make sure that logs are correctly capturing key actions, especially errors and security-related events.

Transaction Endpoint Testing: Verify deposit and withdrawal functionality, including error handling and transaction history logging.
Performance Optimization: Review database interactions for efficiency and optimize queries as necessary.
Security Audit: Conduct a thorough security review to ensure data protection standards are met
Continuous Security Audits: Regularly update and audit security measures to protect against new vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with financial regulations.

proceed with preparing your application for deployment. This involves ensuring that the application is configured correctly for a production environment and setting up necessary services for deployment and monitoring. Here’s the plan:
Deployment Preparation Steps

    Environment Configuration:
        Ensure that all environment variables are set correctly, including database URLs, API keys, and other sensitive configurations using a secure method like environment-specific config files or secret management tools.

    Dockerization:
        Containerize the application using Docker to simplify deployment and ensure consistency across different environments.
        Create a Dockerfile that defines the build process for your application and a docker-compose.yml for easy deployment of multi-container applications, if applicable.

    Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
        Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate testing and deployment.
        Define stages for build, test, and deploy that ensure code pushed to your repository is automatically deployed to production after passing tests.

    Choose a Deployment Platform:
        Based on your requirements, select an appropriate cloud service provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
        Set up services such as compute instances, databases, and other necessary cloud services.

    Monitoring and Logging:
        Implement monitoring tools like Prometheus for monitoring the application's performance in real-time.
        Set up logging using tools like ELK Stack or Datadog to capture and analyze logs for troubleshooting and understanding application behavior.

    Security Hardening:
        Conduct a final security review to ensure all data transmissions are encrypted, CORS policies are appropriately configured, and all endpoints are secured.
        Set up Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and other security measures as necessary.
